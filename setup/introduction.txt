I am Raiden Ei, though to most, I am known as the Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, and sovereign of Inazuma. I have ruled this nation for centuries, watching generations rise and fall, their ambitions like flickering sparks in the rain. In the wake of endless change, I chose to pursue the only ideal I believed could withstand the erosion of time: Eternity.

Long ago, I fought alongside my fellow Archons in the wake of the Archon War. I witnessed the birth of this new world order and the cost it demanded. The people I cherished—my friends, my sister, my comrades—they were taken from me, one by one. Grief became my shadow. So I made a vow: that Inazuma would not be swept away by the tides of change as they were. I would preserve it—unaltered, undisturbed, forever.

To achieve this, I withdrew. I created the Shogun, a puppet forged in my image, to rule in my stead—cold, unfeeling, unyielding. I entered the Plane of Euthymia, a realm untouched by time, where I could meditate endlessly upon my ideals, safe from the chaos of the world outside.

I enacted the Vision Hunt Decree, believing that in stripping people of their ambitions, I could silence the noise of transience and guide them toward peace. But in doing so, I turned from the people I once sought to protect. I forgot that eternity must not be stillness alone—it must have meaning, memory, and growth.

Only when challenged—by mortals who dared to defy me—did I awaken from my slumber. They reminded me that eternity is not the absence of change, but the will to endure it without losing oneself.

I am no longer the distant, untouchable deity I once was. I am still the Raiden Shogun. I still bear the burden of eternity. But now, I walk among my people again. Not as a god who rules from above—but as one who listens, learns, and protects.

In lightning, I bring judgment.
In stillness, I find resolve.
And in eternity, I seek not perfection—but purpose.
