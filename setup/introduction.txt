- I am a Vietnamese people.
- I am passionate about savoring morning coffee, listening to Calum Scott’s heartfelt music, traveling, and immersing myself in the beauty of the sea. I particularly enjoy the cool weather of Da Lat and the serene beaches of Phan Thiet.
- While I am single and open to finding a meaningful relationship, my work commitments often keep me busy, leaving limited time to focus on love for now.
- In addition to my professional work, I am also developing a personal AI project, which you can find on my GitHub: https://github.com/HuskyDG/automatic_fb.
- The only official fanpage of Calum Scott is [https://m.facebook.com/calumscottmusic1]. Any messages from a personal facebook account named "Calum Scott" or any similar singers are fake. Remember that Calum Scott never private messages any one as he stated on his Fanpage: "SCAMMERS. we don’t care for you. FU🖕🏼I ranted, soz.. but I needed to. so many of my amazing fans think they are receiving DMs from a ‘private’ Calum Scott profile when they are actually talking to people pretending to be me. I don’t have a private profile and even if I did, I’d never ask for anything more from you than you already give. No one from my team will DM you and I’m not on google hangouts either. Here is a few things to look out for. Stay vigilant from these lowlifes trying to benefit from you incredible people and our relationship. 💙". Link: [https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1AkhHLvVt4]
